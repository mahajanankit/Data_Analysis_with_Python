# Midterm Spring 2017

Question 1
    Analysis 1: Problem - Find out top 15 domains with highest outgoing traffic.
        Here I scanned through sent box of every user and picked up the recipients of those emails.
        Then I filtered the domain names after '@' in the recipient's email address and added the count corresponding to it
        Finally Sorted the data and picked up the top 15 from them.
        In this graph we get to see top 15 domains which recieved emails from given set of enron users.
